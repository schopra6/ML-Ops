### Experiment tracking

We'll use [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) to track our experiments and store our models and the [MLflow Tracking UI](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#tracking-ui) to view our experiments. We have been saving our experiments to a local directory but note that in an actual production setting, we would have a central location to store all of our experiments. I can spin up your own MLflow server in [Comet](https://www.comet.ml/), etc.
